            <p style="color:white;">><b>Subedar Karnail Singh</b> (46) belonged to 10 Dogra regiment and was a resident of Bishna in Jammu. He was among
            the 19 brave hearts who laid down their lives in the line of duty in September 2016 when Pakistani
            terrorists struck the Armyâ€™s Administrative base in Uri sector of J & K.</p>

        <p style="color:white;">He was one of the 19 soldiers who was martyred in Uri Attack in Sep 2016. At around 5:30 a.m. on 18
            September, four militants attacked an Indian Army brigade headquarters in Uri, near the Line of Control in a
            pre-dawn ambush. They lobbed 17 grenades in three minutes followed by indiscriminate firing by automatic
            weapons. As a rear administrative base camp, the HQs had a fuel storage facility, which caught fire along
            with tents with soldiers sleeping in them. As a result of this dastardly attack, 17 army personnel were
            martyred. A gun battle ensued that lasted for six hours, during which all the four militants were killed. An
            additional 19-30 soldiers were also reported to have been injured in the attack. Most of the soldiers
            martyred were from the 10 Dogra and 6 Bihar regiments. One of the injured soldiers succumbed to his injuries
            on 19 September at R&R Hospital in New Delhi, followed by another soldier on 24 September, bringing the
            death toll to 19.</p>
